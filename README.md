# McDis-RCON  

McDis-RCON is a Python-based application that allows you to stream a Minecraft server console to Discord, enabling remote and efficient server management through a Discord bot.  

## ‚ú® Features  

- **Support for English and Spanish**  
- **Process control**: Start, stop, restart, and terminate servers with ease.  
- **Console streaming**: View and interact with the server console directly from Discord.  
- **Backup system**: Automatically create backups for increased security.  
- **File explorer**: Manage server files with built-in basic operations.  
- **Process manager**: Monitor and manage processes within the McDis execution folder.  
- **Plugin support**: Run plugins for active processes.  
- **Addon system**: Extend bot functionality without depending on an active process.  
- **Predefined commands**: Execute custom commands in the console whenever needed.  
- **Advanced error reporting**: Program errors are detected and automatically reported on Discord, making monitoring and troubleshooting easier.  
- **Compatibility with multiple launchers**: Works with Fabric, Paper, Vanilla, and more (any Java-based process).  
- **Does not modify the Minecraft server**: McDis-RCON runs processes using `Popen`, similar to MCDR.  
- **Compatible with MCDReforged**.  

### üìå Configuration example  
McDis-RCON can manage multiple servers simultaneously. Example with three servers (`smp`, `cmp`, `mmp`) and a network (`velocity`).

## üöß Known Issues  

McDis-RCON has been tested for several months on six servers. Although it is stable, there are some minor known issues:  

- In very rare cases, one of the consoles may freeze. This issue has only been reported on one of the six servers and occurs very infrequently. I am currently working on identifying the cause and resolving it.  
- Occasionally, the `ruamel.yaml` module does not install correctly.  

McDis-RCON is still in development, but its core features are already well implemented.
